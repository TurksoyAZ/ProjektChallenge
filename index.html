            <p>
              Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
              could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I
              wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had
              only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for
              some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I
              thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a
              daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was
              that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
              problem.

          <h3>Start with asking</h3>

          <p>
            why You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more
            effective ways of achieving goals.

          <h3>Your ideas will have more value</h3>

          <p>
            By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will
            be fresher and more valuable.

          <h3>Design solutions with love</h3>

          <p>
            Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the
            frustration of the users and resolve to end it.

          <h3>Share and show your work</h3>

          <p>
            As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that‚Äôs not
            finished or doesn‚Äôt look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback
            and learn from it.

            <p>
              It has to be a problem that‚Äôs personally affecting or affected
              you, like finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering
              something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close

            <h3>Think about the solution</h3>
            <p>
              It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these
              problems? It's time to think out of the box, grab your notebook
              and start writing down all the ideas that come to mind.

              How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about
              features and functionality, and then start designing. Don‚Äôt forget
              to always ask yourself: Would I actually use this?
